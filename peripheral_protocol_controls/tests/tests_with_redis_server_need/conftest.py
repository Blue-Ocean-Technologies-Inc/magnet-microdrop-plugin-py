"""Conftest for peripheral_protocol_controls Redis-integration tests.

The broker MUST be configured at module load time, before any test
modules import code that registers @dramatiq.actor decorators —
otherwise those actors register against the default StubBroker and
the RedisBroker we'd swap in via fixture wouldn't see them, producing
an ActorNotFound when the worker tries to dispatch.

NOTE: The parent tests/conftest.py already calls configure_dramatiq_broker()
so that all actor imports in non-Redis tests also land on the RedisBroker.
We do NOT call it again here — a second call creates a new broker instance
and wipes previously-registered actors.

Skips the entire module if Redis isn't reachable.

Mirrors dropbot_protocol_controls/tests/tests_with_redis_server_need/conftest.py
