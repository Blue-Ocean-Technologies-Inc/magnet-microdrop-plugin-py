"""Z-Stage wiring for the shared firmware-upload dialog.

The dialog itself (model / view / controller) is device-agnostic and lives in
``microdrop_utils.firmware_upload_dialog``; here we just build one wired to
the peripheral live_state, publisher, topics, and the slimmed port-only
panel (the mr-box firmware is bundled — nothing to configure beyond the
port and timeout).
